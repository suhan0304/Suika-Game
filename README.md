## Introduce
This is a copy of Nintendo's 'Suika Game'. It was produced based on the lecture video on ‘Gold Metal’ YouTube. This is a game where you can raise the level of a round dongle by dropping it and combining it with dongles of the same level, and the goal is to create as many dongles of the highest level as possible.
